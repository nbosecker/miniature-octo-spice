    <p>Run to the top of the hill hugging every shade of green imagined and another one even more beautiful swells up in response no thinned-out sunburnt spots exist the streets nestle down low under the tree the branches create an overpass leading to another world that world above the branches gleams with light and crisp air bounced around by breezy clouds the world below the branches is gritty to the eyes and nose filled with loamy lumps of coal-dark soil and spongy blue-black moss creeping along the ground and then up the sides of most things natural hammocks made of grapevine tangle up the mid-region themselves filled with mazes of webs and detritus of old bugs and leaves sounds of tweets chirps buzzes and fuzzy drones drape the forest in an orchestral soundtrack with no visible players something is always moving either in front of next to or in that space where you can see behind your eyes right now that something is the Stealy River carrying bugs the size of boys&rsquo; fists on its surface like surfers and lively crappies just under the grey-green glass they&rsquo;re playing tag with the rounded points of the current <br />
lap lap lap River Stealy continues it winds around piers of old abandoned steel mills littered with rusted copper coils too worthless now for the jailbirds to hock and doors without hinges and forklifts without fronts with sun glaring through the lifts look like giant beetles with their front jaws missing the Stealy heads south to the YOUR TREAT Diner where retired mill men play checkers or fill out The Rome Torch&rsquo;s daily crossword puzzle sincerely or maybe not the banks of the river water lap up at Crazy Horse High School stadium revealing the pilings and bolts under the uprights on the football field when it rains crazy heavy you can take a dive at 10 yards out and bodysurf through to a touchdown next to the school are these town locales in no particular order The Rome Sherriff&rsquo;s Dept. Harrah&rsquo;s Dog the local bar The Rome Torch weekly newspaper office The Roman Day Community Center The Native American Burial Mounds Historical Center and Danny P.&rsquo;s GoodNites Hotel each of these places uses the wildness of the area in some way to its advantage for example you can walk right into an ancient burial mound to enter the Welcome to Rome Guest Center I wonder what the shamans think of that why it&rsquo;s almost as if Rome were built in your own imagination instead of along the Cascades and the Stealy River and that&rsquo;s not the only thing that seems more surreal than real in Rome get this in mid-town is a statue that actually glows whenever a baby is born those who believe local legend listen to the ground for messages told by the old ones when the statue comes to life also certain trees it is said can make people change from young to old from boy to girl from one race to another these trees were brought as seeds from travelers from another planet more than 20,000 years ago and some of these &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; actually still live in this town these ancient beings like to lead people in need of help or punishment to these trees but all of this is true only for those who believe the legends of Rome and you can decide that for yourself if you dare to visit<br />
